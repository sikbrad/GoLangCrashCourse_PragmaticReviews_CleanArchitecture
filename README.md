# Introduction

It is example golang project that implements clean architecture.

Followed the footstep of "[Go Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd-8mb6HfGA&t=748s)" youtube of 'Pragmatic Reviews' channel. 

It uses clean architecture, with classical layered architecture. Tried to follow the channel's footsteps as close as possible, but there's few changes because golang language specs got bit changed. You will se that in comment section.

The main reason I started to re-implement this particular project is because it re-implements clean architecture in go, making bob proud again.

Chapters through 1 to 6 are covered, which has more ties to clean architecture per se, not intentionally covering other 'feature-like' concepts.
